### One Command to Go Live: Transforming Development with cfex

Imagine this: You’re a developer debugging a crucial feature or presenting a demo to a client. Typically, you’d push your changes to staging, configure DNS, or wrestle with NAT rules—burning precious time. What if you could skip all that and make your local environment live with a single command?

With **cfex** (Cloudflare Exposer CLI), this isn’t a dream. Here’s how it works:
```bash
cfex demo.yourdomain.com:3000
```

In just seconds, your application is live at `https://demo.yourdomain.com`, ready for testing, feedback, or sharing updates. No staging servers, no delays—just seamless iteration.

### The Problem: Sharing Local Environments is Painful

Developers and teams often struggle to:
1. Share local development environments with clients, collaborators, or stakeholders.
2. Test APIs, webhooks, or features without a staging server.
3. Configure HTTPS and custom domains securely.

These challenges introduce delays, create bottlenecks, and demand extra technical steps for what should be a simple task.

### Competitor Comparison: How cfex Stands Out

Here’s how **cfex** compares to tools like **ngrok**, **LocalTunnel**, and **cloudflared**:

| Feature                    | cfex (with cloudflared)    | ngrok                | LocalTunnel           | cloudflared          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Custom Domains**         | Free, with your own domain | Paid Plan Only       | Limited               | Supported            |
| **DNS Automation**         | Integrated with Cloudflare | Manual               | Manual                | Requires scripting   |
| **HTTPS Security**         | Included                   | Included (generic)   | Included              | Included             |
| **Ease of Use**            | Single command setup (post cloudflared setup) | Easy | Easy       | Requires setup       |
| **Cost**                   | Free                       | Free/Paid Plans      | Free                  | Free                 |

**Why cfex?**
